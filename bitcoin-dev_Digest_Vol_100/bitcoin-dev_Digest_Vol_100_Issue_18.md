Hi list,

(cross-posting this to bitcoin-dev and lightning-dev since it may be
relevant for both)

The first Bitcoin Research Day will be held at Chaincode (Midtown NYC) on
October 27th, 2023. We are aiming to bring together researchers and
developers to discuss what makes Bitcoin a truly robust, secure, and
decentralized system.

The day will include both longer format talks (speakers include: Benedikt
B?nz, Ethan Heilman, Ittay Eyal, Carla Kirk-Cohen, Murch, and Martin
Zumsande, among others) as well as lightning talks (~5 min) to present
ongoing research and development. Slots for the latter are still available.
If you have something you'd like to present, feel free to sign up (
https://www.brd23.com/#lightning-talks).

We welcome people from both spaces to attend and be part of the discussion.
This is an in-person event, check https://www.brd23.com/ to RSVP.

Clara and Sergi
