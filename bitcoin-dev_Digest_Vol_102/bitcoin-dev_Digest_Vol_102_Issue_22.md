Could be done but it's overkill.
Running your own mail server is not that scary as the initial post makes it out
to be. Sending out spam is problematic only when you allow imap/pop3 access
which is not the case when running a mailling list.

My suggestion is to get the Bitcoin CEO hook us up on https://lists.freebsd.org
Failling that I volunteer to get the same setup going for a community run
project.
