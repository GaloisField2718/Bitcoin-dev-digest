I don't think email should be out of the question. Does anyone besides

Let's do what's necessary to stick with email.

Hi Overthefalls,

+1

Using google for bitcoin mailing list is not good. It feels embarrassing that some developers that built and maintained the only decentralized network used to settle uncensored payments and some of them even working on nostr, can't build their own mailing list which is better than present mailing list. I have some ideas but it seems the influential developers have already decided and wont accept anything.

Nostr can be used to build a mailing list which also allows anyone to send emails apart from publishing events from different clients. We just need a new NIP so that nostr relays understand its a different event. There can be multiple front end with different levels of moderation to hide some emails and ultimately one will be used the most. It can use multiple relays and relays share some information in NIP 11 which can include an email address.
