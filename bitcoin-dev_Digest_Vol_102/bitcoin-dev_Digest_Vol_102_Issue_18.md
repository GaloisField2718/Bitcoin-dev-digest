I think GitHub Discussions is a great idea. If we are considering proprietary options like Google Groups, then we should definitely consider Discussions.

1. Guaranteed that nearly everyone participating here already has a GH account.
2. Offers many moderation options.
3. Good formatting abilities(tables!).
4. Can @ people.
5. Ability to categorize, close, lock discussions, etc.
6. Many great potential opportunities for automation via Actions.
7. Comes with added benefits such as a wiki, issues, etc.

My one catch is that I do not know what kind of interactions you can have with Discussions via email. This seems to be an important feature for many. What level of email notifications can you receive? Can you respond via email?

We increasingly have been using this at Blockchain Commons as everyone is using already using GitHub. We have also created some GitHub actions to backup discussions so that GitHub will not be a central point of failure -should be possible to create a static page archive using GitHub pages (but have not had budget for that).

Hi, I also have faced this same problem, and here?s my solution to it:

Use the latest version of https://www.simplemachines.org/ .

This is the same forum software that powered Bitcointalk, Silk Road, etc.

It has many advantages over every other platform out there:

1. It has great anti-spam prevention tools.
2. It gives you the tools you?ve requested with respect to moderation (individual moderation accounts with customizable permissions).
3. It is simple to use.
4. It is pretty and well designed, and allows you to organize threads and forums really well (unlike Discourse).
5. It doesn?t make unnecessary use of JavaScript (unlike Discourse), and therefore works well with all search engines (present and future).
6. You can self-host it, and migrate it to another server if needed, allowing the community to maintain full control over the data (unlike Microsoft/Github).
7. It supports great search functionality.
8. It is open source, and has many community plugins.
9. It runs anywhere PHP runs.
10. It is fast.
11. It has a well established history of powering Bitcoin communities. It has been with us from Day 1.

After using phpBB for years, researching other forums software, I switched to SMF, and stuck with it. I?m happy I did so. I recommend it.

Kind regards,
Greg Slepak

Agreed, email lists are the way. Personally I love reading the email list; it is a great resource to know what kinds of technical discussions are going on in the community. I certainly hope we can just migrate to a different email list.

I also think that good archives are extremely important. Far more important
than being a medium of discussion is capturing all of that discussion for
posterity. An unbelievable amount of knowledge capital has been built up in
the mailing list over the years and given that Bitcoin is a system that
needs to survive complete turnover in its contributor base, it's of extreme
importance that we have a system that can capture the archive.

While Nostr might be good towards the end of being very resilient it isn't
mature enough to have good UX's built up around it wherein people with a
variety of backgrounds can engage it. Personally, I think the email UX
leaves a lot to be desired but at least it's accessible to a lot of people.
I don't think I can say the same for Nostr yet.

I won't opine much further on the solution but I think the properties we
need to solve for are:

1. Archive is effectively permanent
2. Accessible to a wide audience
3. Data format is not proprietary and isn't tied to the success or failure
of a particular organization

In principle I think that Nostr can offer a lot in the long term towards
this goal, but it isn't really an immediate solution to this problem.
